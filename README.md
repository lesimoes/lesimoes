Hey! I'm Leandro — a software engineer who loves building things that *actually* solve problems.

With 10+ years of experience, I’ve shipped products for startups, led engineering teams, and even co-founded a tech company.

---

## Tech I’m fan (but not limited to)

- TypeScript (We can always use any or unknown)
- AWS & Self hosted addiction (things should run outside of my machine)
- Docker (I'm lazy enough to settuping VPS)
- OpenTelemetry (yes, I like seeing what my code is doing)  

## Some open source projects

- [Clean-node: List all "node_modules" directories using multi-thread ability of Node environment](https://github.com/lesimoes/clean-node)
- [Diagnosis Chatbot: A chatbot that can identify health problems based on symptoms](https://github.com/lesimoes/diagnosis-chatbot)
- [SQS Huge Message: Handle the size limitation of AWS SQS messages](https://github.com/lesimoes/sqs-huge-message)
