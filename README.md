Hey! I'm Leandro — a software engineer who loves building things that *actually* solve problems.

With 10 years of experience, I’ve shipped products for startups, led engineering teams, and even co-founded a tech company.

## Tech I’m fan (but not limited to)

- TypeScript (We can always use any or unknown)
- AWS & Self hosted addiction (things should run outside of my machine)
- Docker (I'm lazy enough to settuping VPS)
- OpenTelemetry (yes, I like seeing what my code is doing)
